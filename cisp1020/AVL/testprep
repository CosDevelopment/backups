1) simple intructions averaging once clock ->>>>>>>. risc
2) single register set -> cisc
3) complexity in the compiler -> risc
4) highly pipelined -> risc
5) any instruction can reference memory -> cisc
6) instructions are interpreted by the microcode ->>> cisc
7) fixed length, easily decoded instruction format ->>> risc
8) Highly specialized, infrequently used instructions ->>> cisc
9) use of overlapping register windows -> cisc
10) relatively few addressing modes ->risc
